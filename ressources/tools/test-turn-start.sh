# Self-test for ressources/tools/arena-turn-start.sh.
#
# Run after ANY edit to the turn-start script:   bash ressources/tools/test-turn-start.sh
#
# It builds a throwaway clone in a temp directory and feeds the script every state
# it claims to handle. Safety properties, on purpose:
#   * the real repository is only ever READ (used as the source for a bare clone);
#   * the real 'origin' remote is never contacted, so no test can push or reset it;
#   * the temp copy is deleted on exit.
#
# Why this exists: the predecessor of the turn-start script would have hard-reset a
# branch with unpushed commits and eaten mid-turn work. Scenario 'ahead' and
# 'ahead+dirty' exist so that mistake can never come back silently. Dogfooding the
# script in a scratch clone is the cheapest way to keep that promise honest.
